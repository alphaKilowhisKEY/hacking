# ARP Spoofing Tools

## Overview

These scripts are designed to demonstrate ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing techniques for educational purposes. ARP spoofing is a type of attack where an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network. The goal of these scripts is to either perform ARP spoofing attacks or detect ARP spoofing attacks on a network.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Make sure you have scapy library installed.
3. Modify the `VICTIM_IP` and `ROUTER_IP` variables in the script to match the IP addresses of the victim machine and the router.
4. Run the script using `$python3 main.py`.
5. Press `CTRL + C` to stop the attack.
